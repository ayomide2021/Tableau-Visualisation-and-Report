# Executive Summary

This project provides a comprehensive overview of job growth across UK cities from 2011 to 2014, with a specific focus on industry-wise distribution and city-level job changes.

•	Overall, Job Growth: The total number of jobs increased by 443,276 during this period, with London seeing the most significant growth, adding approximately 400,000 jobs.

•	Industry Trends: The Professional Services sector experienced the highest job growth (+134,655), followed by Administrative Services and Real Estate Activities, while industries such as Mining and Quarrying saw minimal increases.

•	City-Level Analysis: London not only had the highest number of jobs in both 2011 and 2014 but also the largest increase in job numbers. Other cities like Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool also saw substantial job growth, reflecting their roles as economic hubs.

•	Visual Insights: The map visualization highlights the concentration of jobs in specific cities, while bar charts and color-coded heatmaps provide detailed insights into industry-specific job changes.

These findings underscore the continued concentration of jobs in major UK cities, particularly in service-oriented industries, and the need for targeted policies to support balanced economic growth across the country.


# Business Problem
The project visualizes job trends across various UK cities between 2011 and 2014, highlighting changes in the number of jobs by industry and location. The problem addressed here is the need to understand how job distribution has evolved over this period, particularly in key industries and metropolitan areas. This analysis is critical for stakeholders, including policymakers, city planners, and business leaders, who require insights into regional employment trends to inform economic development strategies and resource allocation.


# Objectives
Using visualisation and calculated field in Tableau, I aim to answer the following questions 

•	How has the total number of jobs in UK cities changed between 2011 and 2014?

•	Which industries have experienced the most significant job growth or decline during this period?

•	What is the geographic distribution of jobs across different UK cities, and how has it evolved from 2011 to 2014?

•	How can policymakers, city planners, and business leaders use this data to make informed decisions about economic development and resource allocation?

•	Which UK cities are emerging as key economic hubs, and what factors are driving their job market growth?

•	What are the opportunities and challenges in specific industries based on their job growth trends, and how can these insights guide strategic planning?
